    <h2> Here's all the buzz about <i>Honey Bees</i>
    <h3><b>Honey bees</b> <i>(Apis mellifera)</i> are highly <b>social flying insects</b> that live in large
                colonies with a single queen. They are crucial pollinators for ecosystems and agriculture, and they
                produce honey from nectar. The three castes of a hive are the queen, who lays eggs, the female worker
                bees, who build and maintain the hive and collect food and the male drones.<br>
    <h3><b>Beekeeping and apiculture</b> are interchangeable terms for the practice of maintaining honey bee
                    colonies in hives. This activity is done to harvest products like honey and beeswax, and to provide
                    pollination services for crops."Apiculture" is derived from the Latin word for bee, apis, and is a
                    more scientific term for the practice, while "beekeeping" is the common term used in English.
    <h2> Why Honey Bees are important
    <h3>Honey bees are crucial because <mark>they are vital pollinators, ensuring the reproduction
                                of many plants, including about a third of the world's food crops, which contributes to
                                biodiversity and food security.</mark> They also provide valuable products like honey,
                            beeswax, and royal jelly.
